    <h2>Why #2:</h2>

<section>
    <p>Attack on Titan puts the viewer into a world where some humans live in fear every day. Giant man-like
    monsters are the enemy of humankind. The anime focuses around an individual named Eren Jaeger, who lost
    his mother to a titan attack. Living like cattles, surrounded by giant walls meant to keep the titans out,
    Eren swore to kill all the titans. However, as the story progressed, Erin himself obtained the power to 
    turn into a titan. Through the twists and turns and suspense from the plot, it kept me wanting 
    to know more. Until the very end.</p>
