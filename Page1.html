    <h2>Why #1:</h2>

<section>
    <p>As far as story telling goes, Dragon Ball has every anime beat. Dragon Ball was created by Akira Toriyama in 1984.
    The Dragon Ball series focuses on Goku, a warrior from the alien race called Saiyans who was originally sent to 
    conquer Earth. However, due to an accident of falling into a ravine while he was a baby hitting his head really hard, 
    he became good and forgot all about that. As the story progressed, he got married and had two sons, Gohan and Goten. 
    He also has the best rival, Vegata, the prince of all Saiyans and the proudest warrior ever existed. Goku even died 
    twice to protect Earth, and came back to life! To top it off, he battles amongst the Gods! As the anime is still ongoing
    in 2024, with the latest film released in 2023, there is no doubt why Dragon Ball shouldn't be #1.</p>
