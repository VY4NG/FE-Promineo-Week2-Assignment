    <h2>Why #3:</h2>
    
<section>
    <p>In terms of emotional connection to an anime story, Demon Slayer tops it. The protagonist of the
    story is a teenager named Tanjiro Kamado. The story takes the viewer through the struggles and battles
    that Tanjiro encounters. Tanjiro, having already lost his father due to illness, lost his whole family
    except his sister, Nezuko, during a demon atack by Muzan Kibutsuji, the original demon. Basically, Muzan
    is the strongest demon ever existed since he was the first demon. Although Nezuko survived the attack, 
    she herself turned into a demon. Tanjiro's mission throughout the anime is to return his sister back to normal.</p>
